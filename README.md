# domain-lookup

This is a little website app that I made for myself to use at a previous job to make my job faster.

It looks up the Whois information of a domain name as well as the MX, A, CNAME and Name Servers of a domain name.

due to removing some information specific to my old job the tool currently does not work however it is on my short list of things to fix
